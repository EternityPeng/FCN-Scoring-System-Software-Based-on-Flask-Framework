# LLM Scoring System Software Based on Flask Framework
 The project aims to improve semantic segmentation results by integrating Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) with different feature extraction backbones, such as AlexNet, ResNet, EfficientNet, and MobileNet. Various datasets, including the PASCAL VOC dataset, were used for training and validation, with evaluation metrics like Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) to measure model performance.
